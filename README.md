## Behavior-Based Sheepdog Herding Model 
This repository contains an implementation and evaluation of a behavior-based sheepdog herding model as described in the paper by Cai et al. [1]. The model explores the use of a social force model to guide sheepdog behavior in herding sheep.

### Introduction
Recent advancements in sheep-sheepdog agent modeling have primarily focused on reinforcement learning, which has shown powerful results. However, this paper examines a behavior-based approach, which offers direct insight into the decision-making process of biological agents. The study of sheep herding is relevant to various engineering tasks, such as swarm robotics or unmanned vehicle navigation. To learn more about the methodology and experimental descign review the pdf in the repository. The code is fully written in python=3.9 and requires the packages from the requirements.txt file. To download those packages "pip install -r requirements.txt". After running the program an html file will pop in the folder the program originated from. The html is playable to see the functionality of the algorithms explored, to change algorithms one will have to select which algorithm in the code to change it. For a better comprehension of the different feel free to read the attached paper. Delete the html after use as it takes alot of storage up.
